# Movement Prediction

- Back-end: Django (run with: `python manage.py runserver`)

- Front-end: React.js (run with: `npm start`)

PLAN:

- Based on first few points in the path, should this software predict a future route.
For a beginning, let's just predict the start.
Make sure list of points is variable, so that query can consist of > 2 points.

- The predicted route should also depend on a day of the week. If it is a working day and so on


OPTIONAL:

- Color the routes depending on a probability user takes them.

- Training data should first look for users moving data, but if none is found, then general data.
