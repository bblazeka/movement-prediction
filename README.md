- Server: Django

- Client: React.js

PLAN:

Based on first few points in the path, should this software predict a future route.
Make sure list of points is variable, so that query can consist of > 2 points.
The predicted route should also depend on a day of the week.
Copy everything else from the paper.

OPTIONAL:

Color the routes depending on a probability user takes them.
Training data should first look for users moving data, but if none is found, then general data.
